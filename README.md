I was a dummy and accidentally deleted the templated project from my hard drive, so I had to reset everything manually after cloning the repo. So things are hacked and they may not work if you pull the repo.
  - I made a VULKAN_SDK environment variable in my solution that links to the most recent VulkanSDK version on my C: drive, so you will have to find a way to replace your own. I currently don't know a better solution.
